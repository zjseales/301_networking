1. Describe multicast and how it is different to unicast and broadcast.
Give an example of a multicast address.

1a. A multi-cast address is the network address of a group of devices.
A unicast address refers to a single device and a broadcast address refers to
all devices.
An example of a multi-cast address would be;
ff02::1
which refers to all nodes on the LAN.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Give an example of a link-local IPv6 address. Briefly describe how 
it is generally formed from the Ethernet MAC address.

2a. Link-Local addresses use the network prefix fe80::/10
The host ID is generated by the Ethernet MAC address
My eth0 MAC address for Client1 is 08:00:27:f0:ee:0d
To create the hostID;
- insert ffee into the middle
0800:27ff:fef0:ee0d
- and change the 2nd least significant bit of the first byte.
0a00:27ff:fef0:ee0d
The final address is all 128 bits;
network ID + host ID = full host address

fe80::0a00:27ff:fef0:ee0d/64
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Give an example of a “unique-local” IPv6 address.

3a. Unique local addresses use the network prefix
fc00::/7
so referencing the above host ID using the unique local address...
fc00::0a00:27ff:fef0:ee0d
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Describe a Solicited Node [multicast] address. What is its purpose? 
Give an example. How is it formed?

4a. Multicast Solicitaton addresses are used to prevent flooding and are 
IPv6's replacement to IPv4's address resolution protocol.
For the above host, it's solicited multicast address will be;
ff02::1:ff00:0/104 + fe80::0a00:27ff:fef0:ee0d/24

ff02::1:fff0:ee0d
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Multicast Listener Discovery version 2 (MLDv2) Snooping is a mandatory 
feature for any switch that wants to support IPv64. What is the motivation 
for MLDv2 snooping, which in the IPv4 world we might compare with 
“IGMP Snooping”? We want to see that you understand its purpose with respect 
to network switches (not routers). You may like to include a diagram with a
little table showing real IPv6 multicast addresses (such as two solicited
node addresses, and an all-routers address (ff02::2) and switch port numbers.

5a. MLDv2 involves using neighbour solicitation nodes and the DAD protocol
to prevent flooding and optimize routing management.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Briefly describe the most important components of a router advertisement.

6a. ICMPv6 prefix gives the the network prefix ID.
Manages Address configuration flag defines whether SLAAC is used or DHCPv6.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Briefly describe Duplicate Address Detection (DAD). Why is it needed and
how is it performed? What do you think the difference is between a 
“Tentative” address and a “Preferred” address, with regard to DAD?

7a. DAD involves sending a neighbour solicitation packet to ensure 
duplicate addresses are not made. If a response is received before 1s then 
the address is in use and can not be duplicated. 
A tentative address is an address that has not yet been verified using DAD.
A preferred address has been.
